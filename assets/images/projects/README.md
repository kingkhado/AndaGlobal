# Project Images Directory

This directory contains images for the projects displayed on the projects.html page.

## How to Add Project Images

To add images for each project, simply place your image files in this directory with the following names:

### Required Image Files:
1. `letaba-hospital.jpg` - For Letaba Hospital Rehabilitation project
2. `etwatwa-sewers.jpg` - For Etwatwa Sewers Construction project
3. `nigel-water-tank.jpg` - For Nigel Water Tank Construction project
4. `evaton-west-sewer.jpg` - For Evaton West Sewer Pipeline project
5. `arlington-sewer.jpg` - For Arlington Sewer Network project
6. `water-leaks.jpg` - For War on Water Leaks project
7. `protea-glen-reservoir.jpg` - For Protea Glen Reservoir project
8. `bulk-meter-telemetry.jpg` - For Bulk Meter & Telemetry project

## Image Requirements:
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Recommended Size**: 800x600 pixels or similar aspect ratio (4:3)
- **File Size**: Keep under 2MB for optimal loading speed
- **Quality**: High quality images that showcase the project work

## How It Works:
- When you add an image with the correct filename, it will automatically display on the projects page
- If an image is not found, a placeholder with an icon will be shown instead
- The placeholder includes the text "Add Project Image" to remind you to add the actual image
- Images will have a nice hover effect that slightly zooms them

## Example:
If you have a photo of the Letaba Hospital project, save it as `letaba-hospital.jpg` in this directory, and it will automatically appear on the projects page.

## Tips:
- Use descriptive, high-quality images that best represent each project
- Ensure images are properly oriented (landscape preferred)
- Consider using images that show the completed work or construction progress
- You can replace any image at any time by uploading a new file with the same name
