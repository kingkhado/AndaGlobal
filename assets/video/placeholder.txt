This directory should contain video files for the hero section:
- hero.mp4 (main hero video)
- poster.jpg (video poster image)

For a real implementation, you would add:
1. A professional construction/engineering video (hero.mp4)
2. A high-quality poster image (poster.jpg) that shows while the video loads

The video should be optimized for web (H.264 codec, reasonable file size).
